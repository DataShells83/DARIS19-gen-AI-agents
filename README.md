# 🧠 Crypto Sentiment Agent — GenAI-Powered News Analyzer

This project was developed as part of the [Kaggle + Google GenAI Capstone 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gen-ai-intensive-course-capstone-2025q1). Our team built a real-time crypto news agent that uses generative AI to analyze headlines, classify sentiment, and provide market insights for on-the-go investors.

## 🚀 Project Summary

**Goal**: Build an intelligent crypto news agent that:
- Scans the latest cryptocurrency headlines
- Performs sentiment analysis using GenAI and traditional NLP
- Summarizes news with natural language
- Visualizes sentiment trends for quick decision-making

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **LangChain** – Agent orchestration
- **Gemini Pro** – LLM response generation
- **FAISS** – Semantic search using vector embeddings
- **HuggingFace Embeddings** – Text to vector transformation
- **TextBlob / VADER** – Rule-based sentiment benchmarking
- **Python** – Core development language
- **Jupyter / Kaggle Notebooks** – Development environment

---

## 🧠 GenAI Capabilities Used

We implemented and explained the following capabilities in our blog and code:
- Structured output (JSON mode)
- Few-shot prompting
- Document understanding
- Function calling
- Agents with tool chaining
- Long context window
- Context caching
- GenAI evaluation
- Grounding
- RAG (retrieval-augmented generation)
- Embeddings & vector search

---

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Fetch News** — Pull crypto headlines from NewsData.io API
2. **Vectorize Headlines** — Use HuggingFace embeddings + FAISS for similarity search
3. **Classify Sentiment** — Gemini classifies tone using few-shot prompting
4. **Summarize** — Gemini generates insight based on retrieved articles
5. **Output** — Reports formatted in Markdown and JSON
