Here are a few beginner-friendly terms that explain what powers this crypto tool:\n\n---\n\n| **Capability** | Tools Used | Beginner-Friendly Explanation | Why We Used It |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Structured Output / JSON Mode / Controlled Generation** | Gemini, Jupyter Notebook | When AI gives its answers in a fixed, easy-to-read format (like filling out a form). JSON is a format like a digital form used to organize info neatly. | Used to classify sentiment labels (Positive/Negative/Neutral) and structure the final report output. |\n| **Few-shot Prompting** | Gemini | Giving the AI a few examples so it understands how to do the task before you ask it to do it on its own. Like showing a student a few math problems before they try one. | Used to guide headline sentiment classification in consistent formats. |\n| **Document Understanding** | Gemini, NewsData.io API | The AI reads a document (like a PDF or invoice) and figures out what it means — who it's from, what it’s about, etc. | Used to extract and analyze the sentiment and content of news headlines. |\n| **Image Understanding** | N/A | The AI looks at a picture and tells you what’s in it — like saying “This is a photo of a dog in a park.” | Not used in this project. |\n| **Video Understanding** | N/A | The AI watches a video and explains what's happening — for example, 'This is a person walking through a grocery store.' | Not used in this project. |\n| **Audio Understanding** | N/A | The AI listens to sound, like a voice or music, and figures out what's being said or played. For example, turning speech into text. | Not used in this project. |\n| **Function Calling** | LangChain, Gemini, FAISS | The AI can call tools or programs to help it do tasks — like asking a calendar app to schedule a meeting or checking the weather. | Used to retrieve relevant news headlines from vector store via search function. |\n| **Agents** | LangChain, FAISS, Gemini | A smart assistant made of multiple AI tools working together. It can plan steps and complete tasks, like a digital helper with its own to-do list. | LangChain Agent coordinated prompt, vector search, and Gemini output. |\n| **Long Context Window** | Gemini | How much the AI can 'remember' at once. A long window means it can read and recall big documents or long conversations without forgetting earlier parts. | Used to classify multiple headlines at once without losing earlier content. |\n| **Context Caching** | LangChain | Saving information from earlier parts of a conversation so the AI doesn’t have to re-read it every time. It makes the AI faster and more efficient. | Used in the LangChain scratchpad to maintain agent history. |\n| **GenAI Evaluation** | Gemini, TextBlob | A way to test how good an AI is at doing tasks — like checking if it gives helpful, safe, and correct answers. | Used to compare headline sentiment via Gemini and TextBlob. |\n| **Grounding** | FAISS, LangChain | Making sure the AI’s answers are based on real facts — like double-checking that it gives accurate, truthful information. | Used to ensure Gemini’s answers were based on retrieved crypto headlines. |\n| **Embeddings** | HuggingFace, FAISS | A way the AI turns words or ideas into numbers so it can understand meaning and find related things — like turning 'cat' and 'kitten' into similar number patterns. | Used to convert crypto headlines into searchable vector format. |\n| **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** | LangChain, FAISS, Gemini | The AI looks up real documents (like websites or files) before answering, so its response is better informed. Like open-book homework. | Used to search headlines and generate summary using grounded sources. |\n| **Vector Search / Vector Store / Vector Database** | FAISS, LangChain | A smart search system where words and meanings are stored as numbers. Instead of keyword search, it finds things based on meaning — like searching 'car' and finding 'automobile.' | Used to store and retrieve news headlines using similarity search. |\n| **MLOps (with GenAI)** | Python, Jupyter Notebook | The tools and processes that help teams build, test, and launch AI systems smoothly — kind of like IT or DevOps for machine learning. | Used lightly to automate structured report generation and exports. |\n\n\n</details>","metadata":{"_uuid":"919319ee-0685-4cb7-a247-46070e5caf72","_cell_guid":"31d64749-2a64-4c6d-b898-4ef364d44afb","trusted":true,"collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 🧠 How We Prompted Gemini\n\nWe used few-shot prompting to make sure Gemini classified crypto headlines consistently:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"examples = [\n    \"Headline: Bitcoin surges 10% on ETF approval news.
