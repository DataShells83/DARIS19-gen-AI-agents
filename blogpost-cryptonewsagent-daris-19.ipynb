    "These GenAI capabilities power the intelligence behind our crypto agent—automating research, spotting sentiment trends, and delivering insights in seconds.  \n",

    "Curious how our AI agent works behind the scenes? Here are a few beginner-friendly terms that explain what powers this crypto tool:\n",
    "\n",
    "| **Capability** | **Tools Used** | **Beginner-Friendly Explanation** | **Why We Used It** |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| Structured Output / JSON Mode / Controlled Generation | Gemini, Jupyter Notebook | When AI gives its answers in a fixed, easy-to-read format (like filling out a form). JSON is a format like a digital form used to organize info neatly. | Used to classify sentiment labels (Positive/Negative/Neutral) and structure the final report output. |\n",
    "| Few-shot Prompting | Gemini | Giving the AI a few examples so it understands how to do the task — like showing a student a few math problems before they try one. | Used to guide headline sentiment classification in consistent formats. |\n",
    "| Document Understanding | Gemini, NewsData.io API | The AI reads a document and figures out what it means — who it's from, what it’s about, etc. | Used to extract and analyze the sentiment and content of news headlines. |\n",
    "| Image Understanding | N/A | The AI looks at a picture and tells you what’s in it — e.g., “A photo of a dog in a park.” | Not used in this project. |\n",
    "| Video Understanding | N/A | The AI watches a video and explains what's happening — e.g., “A person walking through a grocery store.” | Not used in this project. |\n",
    "| Audio Understanding | N/A | The AI listens to music or speech and figures out what’s being said or played. | Not used in this project. |\n",
    "| Function Calling | LangChain, Gemini, FAISS | The AI can call tools or programs to help it do tasks — like asking a calendar app to schedule a meeting. | Used to retrieve relevant news headlines from vector store via search function. |\n",
    "| Agents | LangChain, FAISS, Gemini | A smart assistant made of multiple AI tools working together. It can plan steps and complete tasks. | LangChain Agent coordinated prompt, vector search, and Gemini output. |\n",
    "| Long Context Window | Gemini | How much the AI can “remember” at once — helpful for long documents or chats. | Used to classify multiple headlines at once without forgetting earlier content. |\n",
    "| Context Caching | LangChain | Saves earlier conversation parts so the AI doesn’t have to re-read every time. | Used in the LangChain scratchpad to maintain agent history. |\n",
    "| GenAI Evaluation | Gemini, TextBlob | Tests how well the AI performs (e.g., helpfulness, accuracy, safety). | Used to compare headline sentiment via Gemini and TextBlob. |\n",
    "| Grounding | FAISS, LangChain | Ensures the AI's answers are based on real facts. | Used to ground Gemini’s answers in retrieved crypto headlines. |\n",
    "| Embeddings | HuggingFace, FAISS | Turns words into numbers to understand meaning and find related things. | Used to convert headlines into searchable vectors. |\n",
    "| Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) | LangChain, FAISS, Gemini | AI retrieves real documents before answering — like open-book homework. | Used to search headlines and generate summaries using grounded sources. |\n",
    "| Vector Search / Vector Store / Vector Database | FAISS, LangChain | Searches by meaning (not just keywords) using stored vector representations. | Used to retrieve similar headlines efficiently. |\n",
    "| MLOps (with GenAI) | Python, Jupyter Notebook | Tools and processes that help teams launch and manage AI systems. | Used lightly to automate structured report generation and exports. |\n",
